 ? None 

This is a special constant used to denote a null value or a void. It's important to remember, 0, any empty container (e.g. empty list) do not compute to None. 
It is an object of its own datatype – NoneType. It is not possible to create multiple None objects and can assign it to variables 

? assert 

This function is used for debugging purposes. Usually used to check the correctness of code. If a statement evaluated to true, nothing happens, but when it is false, “AssertionError” is raised. One can also print a message with the error, separated by a comma. 

? Strings are Immutable 
Once a string is defined, it cannot be changed 

 

? map – The map () function applies a function to every member of iterable and returns the result. If there are multiple arguments, map () returns a list consisting of tuples containing the corresponding items from all iterables. 
  
? filter – It takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence for which the function returned True. 
  
? lambda- Python provides the ability to create a simple (no statements allowed internally) anonymous inline function called lambda function. Using lambda and map you can have two for loops in one line
